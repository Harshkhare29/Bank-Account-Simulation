# Bank-Account-Simulation
A Simple Banking System Simulation is an excellent Java project for beginners eager to practice classes, objects, user input, variables, methods, menu-driven programs, and state management. This project simulates banking basics like balance checks, deposits, and withdrawals—all through the console.
What Will This Banking System Do?
Allow users to check their account balance.
Make deposits and withdrawals.
Display account information.
Exit via a menu.
All data is stored in-memory—no external files or databases.
Concepts Practiced in This Project
Classes & Objects: Representing a bank account with fields and methods.
User Input: Using Scanner for seamless interaction.
Conditional Logic: Ensuring valid transactions (can’t withdraw more than the balance).
Menu-Driven Programs: Using loops and switch-case to navigate options.
Encapsulation: Using getters/setters for data protection.
